## 3. Mission Control

As the agents work through the phases of the BMAD methodology, you can monitor their progress in the **Mission Control** terminal. This will show you which agent is currently running, what task it is performing, and any errors that may occur.

Once the generation process is complete, you can review, edit, and download the generated documents in the **Code Editor** tab.
