# Introduction

MVP Agent v2.0 is a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to transform simple startup ideas into professional Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and technical specifications. It leverages the power of AI to automate the process of market research, product planning, and technical design, enabling entrepreneurs and product managers to quickly and efficiently create a comprehensive blueprint for their projects.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** The system is powered by LangGraph and simulates a full product team, including a Market Analyst, PRD Generator, System Architect, UX Designer, and Sprint Planner.
- **Native Search Grounding:** The Market Analyst agent uses Gemini's built-in Google Search grounding to conduct real-time web research, ensuring that the generated documents are based on the latest market trends and data.
- **Code Editor UI:** The application features a modern, IDE-like interface with a file explorer, syntax highlighting, and "Download as ZIP" functionality, making it easy to review and edit the generated documents.
- **Token-Optimized:** The system supports TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) format, which can reduce token usage by 30-60%.
- **Settings Manager:** Users can configure their own API keys, select models (Flash/Pro), and toggle features directly in the UI.
- **Docker Ready:** The application is containerized for easy deployment and hosting.
