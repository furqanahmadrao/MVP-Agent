### 2. Feature Prioritization Matrix ⭐
Make data-driven decisions about which features to build first:

#### RICE Scoring Framework
- **Reach**: How many users will benefit? (quarterly estimate)
- **Impact**: How much will it move the needle? (0.25 to 3.0 scale)
- **Confidence**: How confident are we? (50% to 100%)
- **Effort**: Person-months to implement (0.5 to 6+ months)
- **RICE Score**: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

#### MoSCoW Prioritization
- **Must-Have**: Core functionality, product doesn't work without it
- **Should-Have**: Important but product can launch without it
- **Could-Have**: Nice-to-have, adds value but not critical
- **Won't-Have**: Out of scope for MVP, deferred to v2.0+

#### Value vs. Effort Quadrant
- **Quick Wins** ⚡: High value, low effort (prioritize these!)
- **Major Projects** 🏗️: High value, high effort (plan carefully)
- **Fill-Ins** 🎨: Low value, low effort (do if time permits)
- **Time Sinks** 🚫: Low value, high effort (avoid!)

**Benefits:**
- Focus on high-impact features first
- Avoid wasting time on low-value features
- Communicate priorities clearly to team
- Justify roadmap decisions to stakeholders
